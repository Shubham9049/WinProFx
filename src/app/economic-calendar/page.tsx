            The Forex Economic Calendar is a powerful resource for traders,
            helping them track and interpret events that influence market trends
            and price movements. It provides a chronological overview of major
            national and global economic events, including central bank
            decisions, GDP releases, interest rate updates, Non-Farm Payrolls
            (NFP), and other key indicators.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-400 text-medium  leading-relaxed mb-6">
            These events can significantly impact the financial markets, and
            traders are alerted in real time through notifications available
            under the "Mailbox" tab on their trading platform. Since each event
            may affect instruments differently, understanding the relevance and
            timing of these updates is essential for informed and strategic
            trading.
